# Motivation

One of the most famous personal finance quotes by Warren Buffett is:
>Do Not Save What Is Left After Spending, Spend What Is Left After Saving

It clearly points out the importance of financial management. During this era, there are multiple ways to spend and earn money, and there are even more types of currency. We aim to build a simple application to record the daily expense and income, furthermore, we will help customers to manage their finance by offering a saving plan or provide an overview of what they have spent.
